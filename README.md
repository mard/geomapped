# geomapped

Interactive map with GPX trails and geotagged photographs.

Work in progress.

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

Loads two sets of data: 
* GPX files
* GeoJSON files, containing data extracted from geotagged photos. Generated by
included Python script.

# todo
- geojson builder - pass directory as parameter, copies to img, makes thumbs
- General refactor - pass photoData, trackData as a parameter to library and
operate on already defined map.
- Populate framecontent on the fly - maybe pass div name as a parameter?
- remove legacy code

# prerequisites

* Python 3 with PIL module. Required for generating aforementioned GeoJSON files.
* JavaScript-capable web browser (duh)

# usage

TBD

# examples

public_html folder contains complete usage example along with example data.

Host public_html on a webserver and access example.html to see it in action.
